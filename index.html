    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Burak and I am an artificial intelligence engineering and
      computer engineering double major student. I have been interested in
      coding since middle school and I have been slowly improving my skills. I
      can code Python, C++, C, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I do not have a
      specific career route on my mind and I can easily adjust to your company's
      culture.

        <p>
          In the summer of ninth grade I started my internship in this firm. For
          two months, I observed the projects that the firm was working on,
          joined meetings and presented my ideas. I saw various disciplines work
          together to create a finished product. I learned how a project based
          firm functions and got accustomed to the job environment. During my
          internship, I also studied and learned the C programming language.
